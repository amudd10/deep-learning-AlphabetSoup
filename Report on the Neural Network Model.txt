1. Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures in the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup

2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- Target variable was the IS_SUCCESSFUL column
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- Every column that was not dropped were the features fed into the model
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- 'EIN' & 'NAME'

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
1. Starter Code:
input_features = X_train_scaled.shape[1]
hidden_node1 = 80
hidden_node2 = 30
2 activation functions: relu, sigmoid

2. Optimized model 1:
input_features = X_train_scaled.shape[1]
hidden_node1 = 100
hidden_node2 = 60
hidden_node3 = 20
hidden_node4 = 5
3 activation functions: relu, sigmoid, tanh

3. Optimized model 2:
'num_layers': 5,
activation': 'tanh'
Layer 0 has 5 neurons.
Layer 1 has 1 neurons.
Layer 2 has 1 neurons.
Layer 3 has 3 neurons.
Layer 4 has 9 neurons.
Layer 5 has 9 neurons.
Layer 6 has 1 neurons.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No (did not reach 75%)
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Optimized the model twice i.e removed features, different optimization methods (models, parameters etc.)

3. Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
- The each model were closer and closer to the target accuracy.
- By including more data we can possible achieve a model with 75% accuracy.
